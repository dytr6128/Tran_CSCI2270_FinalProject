Graphs With Linked Lists

This program will simualate a world map with the seven different continents. Within each continent, there will be countries in them, not all of the countries maybe 5 or 6 per continent. To visualize the continental map, I will use a a graph data structure. For the countries, I will use a doubly linked list such as in the Communication Network assignment. I will display a menu prompting to pick a continent, and then within that continent, display another menu allowing the user to add, delete, print, send a message, or delete all the countries in the continent.
